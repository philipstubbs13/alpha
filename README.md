# Alpha

"When there are no more leaders to follow, you must become one." This quote is from the movie Alpha. The movie is about a boy named Keda who goes on his first hunt with his tribe but gets separated after coming face to face with a buffalo. To find his way back home, he forms a close friendship with a lone wolf that also got separated from her pack. To overcome the odds of making it back home and surviving before the harsh, cold winter, Keda must take charge and be strong to not only save his life but also save the life of his new friend. 

This movie and quote really define what I haved faced and battled to get to this point in my life so far. My life has been nothing but easy. I have had to stand up for myself when others around me haven't, be bold when making the right choices, and have courage to continue to move on despite the constant obstacles and challenges in my way. As a result, I created this website so that you can see what I have been through, what I face now, and what I want to pursue next.

For more information about the movie, you can watch the trailer here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNFufvM7qNU>.

## <a name="about-this-project"></a> About this project

This is my portfolio website built using React. It includes information about me, my resume, projects I have worked on, and information on how to get in touch with me.

My original portfolio website was built using vanilla JavaScript and Handlebars. You can find the source code for that site available here: <https://github.com/philipstubbs13/coding-portfolio>. The more I developed that site, the more I became less and less satisfied with it. Over time, it became more and more difficult to maintain. So, that's why I created a new portfolio site with React so that I can update and maintain it quickly as I spin up new projects.

Just a little bit about me... I graduated from the University of Minnesota Full Stack Web Development program in May 2018. This site not only showcases the projects I completed during that program but also projects I am currently working on so that you can get to know a little bit more about me and my life as a web developer. As I continue my web development journey, I will continue to add new projects to this site that you can explore and learn more about.

If you have any questions, comments, or find any issues with the site or one of the projects showcased on this site, feel free to email me at philipstubbs13@gmail.com.
